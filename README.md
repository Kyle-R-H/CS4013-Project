CS4013 Software Development Project 

Your system should store student results (grades in modules each semester) and should perform QCA calculations per semester/year/programme (and others as deemed necessary) for the different types of programmes available in UL. The system should be able to identify students that do not meet the minimum academic standards for progression

Classes needed:
- Student Results
- QCA calculations: PostGrad and Undergrad
- Student information: 
- Course (create course object)
  â€¢ Methods: duration(years), credits(Possibly own class),type(possible own class)(Bachelors of Science, arts, etc; Masters of blah; Doctors of whatever), 
-
